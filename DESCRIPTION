Package: pmsignature
Title: Extracting characteristic mutation signatures from a set of mutation
    data.
Description: This package is an R implementation of PMSignature (Shiraishi et
    al. 2014+), which identifies characteristic mutation patterns concealed in
    large amounts of somatic mutation data. In this method, the generative
    process of each mutaiton follows a mixed membership model, where each
    cancer genome has multiple source of mutations (mutation signatures), and
    each mutation is associated to one of the mutation signatures. By EM
    algorithm, we jointly estimate the mutation signatures and the membership
    parameters.
